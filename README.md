# Bicycle Game.
### Welcome to Oscar's janky command-line-based simulator game!
This game is inspired by Roblox "simulator" games and beyond. Mechanics include the common Roblox simulator gameplay loop, as well as some of the 2D-text-based-friendly mechanics of AdVenture Capitalist.
Bicycle Game. is meant to be a passion project and a place to practice coding more than an actual game, so don't expect much out of it!

### Summary
You have to commute to school. Your mom works the mornings. Is it going to be the mile-long walk just for a bus ride, or is it going to be the bike, which basically takes the same amount of time as the bus commute? Obviously, the answer is your dusty, rusty-chained Wal-Mart bike.
+ Make money by biking... to school... what?
+ Earn favors from friends and opportunities at school. A good, A+ student always has their side hustle of gathering IOUs.
+ Spend money and earn favors for a better ride.
+ Rinse and repeat.

### Notes
The game ain't done.

Thanks for reading!
